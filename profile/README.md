## üî≠ High Energy Astrophysics group ü™ê

The High Energy Astrophysics group ([website](https://hea.physics.muni.cz/)) is a research group in the Department of Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic. 
We are an international research group led by Prof. [Norbert Werner](https://hea.physics.muni.cz/people/norbert.html) and focused on the hot and energetic Universe over multiple wavelengths and physical scales. 
We bridge observational, theoretical, and computational fields over a broad array of disciplines.

Below listed methods were developed by the members of the group and made available to the community. Each repository contains a description of how to use those tools and how to eventually cite them.
